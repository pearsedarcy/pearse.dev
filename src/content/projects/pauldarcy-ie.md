oneLiner: An artist's WordPress site and shop — audited, fixed on staging first, then cut over to a hardened, upgraded live site with a written runbook.
period: Aug – Sep 2026
role: Sole engineer
stack:
  - WordPress 7.1
  - WooCommerce
  - Apache
  - Cloudflare
  - wp-cli
  - Claude Code agents
featured: false
order: 16
features:
  - A full audit over SSH and HTTP by four agents working in parallel — security, WordPress, performance and SEO — that made no change to the server.
  - A staging environment where core, plugin and theme updates were validated before anything touched live.
  - Hardening, compression and caching headers, and SEO fixes including a broken sitemap, all verified on staging first.
  - A cutover runbook in which every step is reversible on its own and nothing starts without a fresh off-server backup.
  - The infrastructure notes, audit and runbooks kept in a private repository, so the next person starts from what is true rather than from memory.
hooks:
  - The brief assumed the shop was not live yet. The audit found it already was, which changed the order of everything after it.
  - Fifty-eight findings, nine of them top priority, from an audit that changed nothing on the server.

    The brief said "make the checkout real". The audit found it already was.

    pauldarcy.ie is an artist's WordPress site and shop. Before changing anything, I ran a read-only audit over SSH and HTTP: four agents in parallel on security, WordPress, performance and SEO. Fifty-eight findings, nine top priority, zero changes to the server.

    That one finding reordered the plan. A live shop is a different job from a shop that's about to launch.

    So everything went through staging first: updates, hardening, compression, the SEO fixes. Then a cutover runbook where each step can be undone on its own and nothing starts without a fresh backup off the server.

    The live site is now on WordPress 7.1, hardened, with a working sitemap.

An artist's website with a shop: WordPress, WooCommerce and a long list of plugins. The brief was to make the checkout real.

I started with an audit that changed nothing. Four agents worked in parallel over SSH and HTTP, one each on security, WordPress, performance and SEO, and came back with fifty-eight findings, nine of them top priority. The first finding turned the brief around: the shop was already live and had already taken payments. Making checkout real was the wrong goal; the work was making a live shop safe and dependable.

Everything after that went through a staging copy first. Core, plugin and theme updates were validated there with no fatal errors, then the hardening, compression, caching headers and SEO fixes. Only then did I write the cutover runbook: every step reversible on its own, and step zero a fresh backup taken off the server before anything else is allowed to run.

The cutover is done. The live site is on WordPress 7.1, hardened, and its sitemap works again. The audit, the runbooks and the infrastructure notes live in a private repository, so the next change starts from a written record of what is true.
