The personal site and the publishing pipeline behind it: case studies, articles, and the social copy that promotes them. One context; the site is the source of truth for everything that gets posted elsewhere.

## Language

### Content

**Case study**:
A page describing one project: what it is, the period, the role, the stack, what it does, and two or three things worth knowing. Lives under Work.
_Avoid_: project page, portfolio item

**Article**:
A long-form post under Writing with a title, description, publication date and tags. May reference one case study.
_Avoid_: blog post, entry

**Publication date**:
The date an article is meant to go live. Articles are compared against this date at build time, in UTC.
_Avoid_: publish date, release date

**Draft**:
An article withheld from the site and from the social feed regardless of its publication date, usually because it still carries verify markers.

**Scheduled**:
A non-draft article whose publication date is still in the future. It has no page yet but it does appear in the social feed, marked as not published.

**Published**:
A non-draft article whose publication date has passed as of the most recent rebuild. It has a page, is in the RSS feed, the sitemap and the Writing index.

**Rebuild**:
The daily automated build and deploy that promotes scheduled articles to published on their date. No content changes are needed to trigger it.

**Verify marker**:
An inline placeholder of the form `[VERIFY: …]` left by a ghost-writer where a fact was not confirmed. Content with a verify marker is never approved.

### Social

**Social copy**:
The ready-to-post text attached to an article: a LinkedIn variant and a short variant for character-limited networks. Written with the article, stored with the article.
_Avoid_: social post, snippet, caption

**Standalone post**:
Social copy that is not attached to any article. Has its own date, pillar and format, and the same approval rules.
_Avoid_: filler post, loose post

**Social feed**:
The machine-readable list of every non-draft article with its social copy and published flag, served at `/social.json`. The only input the scheduler reads.

**Pillar**:
One of three content themes every piece of social copy belongs to: platform building, self-hosted AI in production, agentic engineering.
_Avoid_: topic, theme, category

**Approval**:
The human step where Pearse says yes to a specific piece of social copy before it is posted. Nothing is posted without it.
_Avoid_: sign-off, review

**Scheduler**:
The automation that reads the social feed, asks for approval, posts approved copy to the networks at the planned time, and records what it posted.
_Avoid_: bot, poster, automation

**Posting record**:
The scheduler's log of what was posted where and when, used to avoid posting the same copy twice.
_Avoid_: dedup log, history

### Boundaries

**Confidential**:
Anything in the content inventory's confidentiality list: infrastructure addresses, credentials, customer and congress names, business figures, security internals. Confidential material never appears in the repository or on the site, and the list itself is kept outside the repository.

**Client case study**:
A case study about work for a paying client rather than for MTS. Needs the client's permission before it is published under their name.
