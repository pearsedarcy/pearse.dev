# pearse.dev

Personal site of Pearse D'Arcy. Static, built with [Astro](https://astro.build) 7, Tailwind CSS v4 and a small amount of Three.js. Deployed to GitHub Pages at <https://pearse.dev>.

## Stack

- **Astro 7** — static output, content collections, `@astrojs/rss`, `@astrojs/sitemap`
- **Tailwind v4** via `@tailwindcss/vite`, configured in CSS (`src/styles/global.css`, `@theme` block) with `@tailwindcss/typography` for prose
- **Three.js** (tree-shaken) — hero icosahedron and the About-section stack object, loaded after first paint
- **GSAP** core + ScrollTrigger + SplitText — scroll reveals, loaded on idle
- **Fonts** — Archivo (display, expanded), Inter (body), JetBrains Mono (labels), self-hosted from `@fontsource-variable/*`, latin subset only

Node 22 or newer (`.nvmrc` / `engines`).

## Commands

## Content

Everything editorial is Markdown in `src/content/`, validated by the schemas in `src/content.config.ts`. A missing or mistyped field fails the build.

### Add a project

Create `src/content/projects/<slug>.md`:

```yaml
---

Optional notes in Markdown, rendered under the facts.
```

MTS is presented as exactly two case studies, **MTS Hub** and **wetlabs.app**. Its smaller tools (WetPack, Opthalyze, Atlas, Cortex, the observability stack) are feature sections of those two, not case studies of their own; `tests/mts-products.test.mjs` holds that rule.

When a case study is renamed or folded into another, add its old slug to `MOVED_CASE_STUDIES` in `astro.config.mjs`. The build writes a static redirect page (`<meta http-equiv="refresh">`, canonical, noindex, no JavaScript) at the old `/work/<slug>/`, kept out of the sitemap.

`clientPermission` gates **client case studies** (`category: client`) and is ignored for every other category.

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pending` (default) | No permission yet. The case study is excluded from the home grid, `/work/`, its own page, the sitemap, "next" links and writing-post project links. |
| `granted` | Client agreed to be named. Published as written. |
| `anonymised` | Client agreed on condition of anonymity. Published; the copy must already be anonymised. |

Set the value explicitly on every client case study. `tests/visibility.test.mjs` unit-tests the rule for every value, asserts that `granted` ones are on `/work/` under Client work, and that `pending` ones (read from the source files) are absent from the build.

A client case study names no owner or staff member, no server name or address, and no prices or business figures, whatever its permission value.

Private repositories show "Private repository" and never link.

### Diagrams

A case study can show one architecture diagram under its features, in a figure headed "How it fits together". The frontmatter key `diagram:` names a component in `src/components/diagrams/`; without the key the page has no figure.

To add one:

1. Copy an existing diagram (say `MtsCortex.astro`) to `src/components/diagrams/<Name>.astro`.
2. Describe two layouts in viewBox units: `wide` (shown from 64rem up, about 960 wide) and `narrow` (phones, 360 wide, stacked). Each is a list of `nodes` (box, label, optional `sub` lines, `kind`: service, store, actor, ai or gate for a human approval point) and `edges` between node ids (`flow` for the main path, `both` for two-way, `optional` for opt-in). Edges route orthogonally; use `fromSide`/`toSide`, `fromOff`/`toOff` or `via` when the default crosses a box.
3. Give `Diagram` a `title` and a `desc` that tells the flow in sentences, for screen readers.
4. Add `<Name>` to `DIAGRAM_NAMES` in `src/lib/diagrams.ts` and to `DIAGRAMS` in `src/components/diagrams/index.ts`, then set `diagram: <Name>` on the case study, or on one of its `sections`.

Name only components the case study already names: no hostnames, addresses, customer names or counts. The build fails when a label is too long for its box. Flow edges animate only under `prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference`. Check both layouts at 390 and 1280 px; `tests/diagrams.test.mjs` asserts which titled diagrams each MTS case study renders.

### Add a post

Create `src/content/posts/<slug>.md`. The filename is the URL: `/writing/<slug>/`.

```yaml
---
title: Post title
description: ≤155 characters, used as the meta description.
pubDate: 2026-11-03
updatedDate: 2026-11-10     # optional
tags: [django, agents]
project: mts-hub            # optional, a project slug; links the post and the case study
draft: false
social:
  linkedin: |
    Long-form LinkedIn version, first line is the hook.
  short: "≤280 chars incl. URL, for X/Bluesky/Mastodon."
---
```

Drafts are excluded everywhere. Posts dated in the future are excluded from the HTML pages and RSS until their `pubDate`; the deploy workflow rebuilds every day at 06:00 UTC so they go live on their date.

### Social feed

`/social.json` lists every non-draft article (including scheduled ones), every approved standalone post and every visible case study with a `social` block, oldest first (on one date: articles, then standalone posts, then case studies). Each entry has a `kind`:

```json
[
  { "kind": "article", "id": "…", "slug": "…", "title": "…", "date": "2026-11-03", "pubDate": "2026-11-03",
    "url": "https://pearse.dev/writing/…/", "published": false, "status": "approved", "tags": ["…"],
    "social": { "linkedin": "…", "short": "…" } },
  { "kind": "standalone", "id": "p01", "title": "…", "date": "2026-11-04", "pillar": "Agentic engineering",
    "format": "Short lesson", "visual": "none", "published": true, "status": "approved",
    "social": { "linkedin": "…", "short": "…" } },
  { "kind": "project", "id": "east-coast-blinds", "title": "…", "date": "2027-02-17", "category": "client",
    "url": "https://pearse.dev/work/east-coast-blinds/", "published": true, "status": "approved",
    "social": { "linkedin": "…", "short": "…" } }
]
```

Articles keep their original fields (`slug`, `pubDate`, `url`, `tags`); `id` and `date` are the same values under the shared names. `published` is false for a scheduled article until its page exists, so the scheduler must never link early. Standalone posts have no page and no `url`, and are always `published: true`. A `project` entry's `id` is the case study slug and its `url` the case study page, which always exists for a visible case study, so it is always `published: true`; pending client case studies are never in the feed. The scheduler does not offer `project` entries yet (`isEligible` in `automation/n8n/select.mjs` returns false for any other kind).

An n8n workflow reads it to schedule posts: LinkedIn gets the `linkedin` copy, and Bluesky and Mastodon optionally get the `short` copy (see [`automation/n8n/README.md`](automation/n8n/README.md)). `/rss.xml` carries the published posts.

### Add a standalone post

A standalone post is social copy with no article. Add `src/content/social/<id>.md`; the filename is the id (lowercase, e.g. `p13.md`):

```md
---
title: "Write the rule as a hook, not a sentence"
date: 2026-11-04                 # the day it should go out (UTC)
pillar: "Agentic engineering"    # Platform building (Django) | Self-hosted AI in production | Agentic engineering
format: "Short lesson"           # free text: Short lesson, How we do X, Before/after, …
visual: "none"                   # what to attach, or "none"
status: draft                    # draft | approved
short: "≤300 chars incl. URL, for X/Bluesky/Mastodon. https://pearse.dev"
note: "optional reviewer note"   # optional, not in the feed
---

The LinkedIn copy is the body, first line is the hook.
```

- `draft` (the default) is never in the social feed. Resolve every `[VERIFY: …]` marker before approving: the build fails on an approved post with a marker left in its title, short copy or body.
- `approved` is in the feed straight away, even when dated in the future, so the scheduler can plan around its `date`. The scheduler still asks for a human approve before sending anything (ADR 0004).

The collection is the source of truth: edit the Markdown directly. The first twelve were migrated from a JSON file that has since been deleted; `scripts/migrate-standalone.mjs` is kept only as the record of that migration and must not be re-run.

### Now page

`/now/` renders `src/content/now/now.md`. To update it, edit the file and bump `updated` in the frontmatter; the page shows it as "Updated <Month YYYY>". Keep it public-safe (see ADR 0005).

### CV

`/cv/` is built from the site: contact links and location from `src/lib/site.ts`, the featured and MTS case studies that are visible (pending client case studies are excluded, as everywhere; only the start of each period is shown, and roles are left to the case study pages), and the marquee stack as skills. Facts that exist nowhere else on the site (headline, profile, experience, education, and languages once confirmed) live in `src/content/cv/cv.md`; their wording follows `docs/profile/`, and nothing that still carries a verify marker there goes in. The page has a print stylesheet (A4, black on white, no nav or footer, links spelled out, entries never split across pages); "Download PDF" calls `window.print()`. Keep the print preview at two pages or fewer when adding content.

### GitHub section

Section 04 on the home page shows the public GitHub profile of `pearsedarcy`: a profile card, the last year's contribution heatmap (inline SVG, no client JS) and the six most recently pushed repositories. Every link goes to github.com. `src/lib/github.ts` fetches it once per build:

- Profile and repositories come from the REST API, no token needed. Only public, non-fork repositories owned by `pearsedarcy` are listed, never org repositories; `HIDDEN_REPOS` drops the profile README repo and commissioned work that names a person.
- The contribution calendar comes from GraphQL `contributionsCollection`, which needs `GITHUB_TOKEN`. CI and the deploy pass `github.token`.
- `src/data/github.json` is the committed, already-shaped snapshot. Without network the build uses it whole; without a token it keeps the snapshot's calendar. Either way it logs a `[github]` warning saying so. A successful fetch rewrites the file when the data changed, so a local build with network may leave it modified: commit it or `git checkout` it.
- `GITHUB_FETCH=0` forces the snapshot (offline builds, reproducible tests).
- `tests/github.test.mjs` covers the shaping, the fallback paths with a fake `fetch`, and the rendered section.

## Open Graph images

Every article and visible case study page gets its own 1200x630 card at `/og/<slug>.png`: the title in Archivo, a mono kicker (date and reading time for an article, order, category and period for a case study), the icosahedron mark and `pearse.dev` above the lime bar. Home, index and 404 pages keep `public/og-default.png`, which is committed and regenerated by hand with `npm run og`.

- `scripts/og-pages.mjs` renders the cards with headless Chrome, not satori, because the Archivo width axis only renders faithfully in a browser. It runs as `prebuild`, so `npm run build` (and `withastro/action` on deploy) always regenerates them; `npm run og:pages` runs it alone. Four renders run in parallel, about 2 s for the current pages.
- `public/og/` is generated and gitignored. The script empties it first, so a post that goes back to draft loses its card.
- Which pages get a card follows `src/lib/visibility.ts`, the same publish and visibility rules the pages use: drafts, future-dated articles and `pending` client case studies get none.
- Chrome comes from `CHROME_PATH`, then `google-chrome`, `chromium` or `chromium-browser` on `PATH`. Without one the script warns and every page falls back to the default image, so a local build never fails on it; under `CI` it fails instead. `src/lib/og.ts` picks the page card only when its file exists.
- `og:image:alt` (and `twitter:image:alt`) reads `<Title>, Pearse D’Arcy, pearse.dev`; `twitter:image` mirrors `og:image`.
- `tests/og.test.mjs` checks one distinct card per page, each a real PNG over 10 KB, none for drafts or pending client case studies, and the default on every other page. It skips the image assertions when the build had no Chrome (`.astro/og-pages.json` records the run).

## Motion and degraded paths

- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` — the hero and stack render one static frame; no loops, no pointer reaction; the marquee and letter reveal stop.
- No WebGL — the SVG posters stay in place.
- Force either path for testing with `?reduce` or `?nogl` on any URL.

## Checks

`.github/workflows/check.yml` runs on every pull request and is called by the deploy workflow, whose `build` job needs it green. It runs `npm ci`, `astro check`, the build, the link crawl, the Lighthouse budget, `npm test` and the confidentiality gate.

The gate (`scripts/gate.mjs`, ADR 0005) scans `dist/`, `src/` and `docs/` case-insensitively for patterns that must never ship. Patterns come from the repository secret `CONFIDENTIAL_PATTERNS`: one regular expression per line (case-insensitive, multiline: `^`/`$` match per line), blank lines and `#` comments ignored. Every file is scanned except known binary types and files containing a NUL byte. The `#n` in the output counts patterns (non-empty, non-comment lines), not file lines. The printed path can itself reveal a name, so keep sensitive words out of filenames. Fork and Dependabot PRs receive no secret and so only get the warning. A missing `dist/` fails the gate: build first. On a hit it prints `<file>: pattern #<n>` and fails; it never prints the matched text. With no patterns it passes with a warning annotation, so the workflow works before the secret exists.

Locally, put the same patterns in `.confidential-patterns` at the repo root (gitignored, never commit it) and run `npm run build && npm run gate` before pushing. `CONFIDENTIAL_PATTERNS` in the environment takes precedence over the file.

### Lighthouse budget

`npm run lhci` (`lhci autorun`, config in `lighthouserc.json`) serves `dist/` locally and audits `/`, `/work/mts-hub/` and `/writing/why-i-rebuilt-pearse-dev/` three times each (median asserted) with the default mobile preset. Budgets, each an `error` that fails the PR: performance 0.9 or more, accessibility 1.0, best practices 0.95 or more, SEO 1.0. The URL list is hard-coded: bump the article URL when a new article is published. Run locally with `npm run build && npm run lhci` (set `CHROME_PATH` if Chrome is not found). Reports land in `.lighthouseci/` (gitignored); CI uploads them as the `lighthouse-report` artefact, kept 7 days, even on failure (`include-hidden-files` is needed because `.lighthouseci` is a dot-directory). Order in CI: check, build, link crawl, Lighthouse, then `npm test` (which rebuilds `dist` via `pretest`).

## Requirements

Node 22.23.4 or newer (`.nvmrc`). Astro 7 refuses older 22.x builds, including the 22.23.3 that GitHub-hosted runners cache under a bare `22`, which is why the workflow pins the patch version.

## Deploy

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds with `withastro/action` and publishes with `actions/deploy-pages` on every push to `master`, on the daily schedule, and on manual dispatch. The repository's Pages source must be set to **GitHub Actions**. `public/CNAME` keeps the custom domain; `site` is `https://pearse.dev` with no `base`.

## Docs

- **Profile copy:** [`docs/profile/linkedin.md`](docs/profile/linkedin.md) (LinkedIn headline, About, Experience, Featured, Skills, paste order) and [`docs/profile/bio.md`](docs/profile/bio.md) (50, 100 and 300-word speaker bios), derived from the case studies.
