# Changelog

Notable changes to the site and its publishing pipeline. Newest first. Dates are merge dates.

## 2026-10-28: content model restructure

### Changed
- MTS is presented as two case studies, MTS Hub and wetlabs.app. Folded tools are feature sections, and the old `/work/<slug>/` URLs redirect (ADR 0006).
- The two anonymised client case studies are named: m-buildz.com (`/work/m-buildz/`) and pauldarcy.ie (`/work/pauldarcy-ie/`); the old slugs redirect (#89).
- Four client case studies are visible, named with written permission, and enter the social feed (#48).
- Posts, social copy and profile docs rewritten for the two-product framing (#50).
- Case study story renders before the in-depth sections; case studies are numbered by their place in the `/work/` grid (#65, #77).
- `/work/` header start year is computed from the earliest project period (#86).

### Added
- GitHub section on the home page: profile, contribution heatmap, recent repositories (#49).
- About, CV and Now carry the skating career, origin story and hobbies (#51).
- Skatedownhills case study and draft essay (#46).
- Documentation: ADR 0006 and the content model guide in the README.

### Fixed
- Accessibility: heading outline on `/writing/`, spacing in headings (#73, #74, #84).
- Phone width: case study heading and prev/next nav, heatmap labels (#66, #67).
- Redirect pages opt in to view transitions and wait one second before refreshing (#64, #85).
